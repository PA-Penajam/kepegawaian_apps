## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `wayfinder-development` — Activates whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components. Use when importing from @/actions or @/routes, calling Laravel routes from TypeScript, or working with Wayfinder route functions.
- `pest-testing` — Tests applications using the Pest 4 PHP framework. Activates when writing tests, creating unit or feature tests, adding assertions, testing Livewire components, browser testing, debugging test failures, working with datasets or mocking; or when the user mentions test, spec, TDD, expects, assertion, coverage, or needs to verify functionality works.
- `inertia-react-development` — Develops Inertia.js v2 React client-side applications. Activates when creating React pages, forms, or navigation; using <Link>, <Form>, useForm, or router; working with deferred props, prefetching, or polling; or when user mentions React with Inertia, React pages, React forms, or React navigation.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Styles applications using Tailwind CSS v4 utilities. Activates when adding styles, restyling components, working with gradients, spacing, layout, flex, grid, responsive design, dark mode, colors, typography, or borders; or when the user mentions CSS, styling, classes, Tailwind, restyle, hero section, cards, buttons, or any visual/UI changes.
- `fortify-development` — Laravel Fortify headless authentication backend development. Activate when implementing authentication features including login, registration, password reset, email verification, two-factor authentication (2FA/TOTP), profile updates, headless auth, authentication scaffolding, or auth guards in Laravel applications.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan Commands

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`, `php artisan tinker --execute "..."`).
- Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Debugging

- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- To execute PHP code for debugging, run `php artisan tinker --execute "your code here"` directly.
- To read configuration values, read the config files directly or run `php artisan config:show [key]`.
- To inspect routes, run `php artisan route:list` directly.
- To check environment variables, read the `.env` file directly.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->
```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia client-side patterns.

# Inertia v2

- Use all Inertia features from v1 and v2. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New features: deferred props, infinite scroll, merging props, polling, prefetching, once props, flash data.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== wayfinder/core rules ===

# Laravel Wayfinder

Wayfinder generates TypeScript functions for Laravel routes. Import from `@/actions/` (controllers) or `@/routes/` (named routes).

- IMPORTANT: Activate `wayfinder-development` skill whenever referencing backend routes in frontend components.
- Invokable Controllers: `import StorePost from '@/actions/.../StorePostController'; StorePost()`.
- Parameter Binding: Detects route keys (`{post:slug}`) — `show({ slug: "my-post" })`.
- Query Merging: `show(1, { mergeQuery: { page: 2, sort: null } })` merges with current URL, `null` removes params.
- Inertia: Use `.form()` with `<Form>` component or `form.submit(store())` with useForm.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pest documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pest-testing` every time you're working with a Pest or testing-related task.

=== inertia-react/core rules ===

# Inertia + React

- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia React client-side patterns.

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

# Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with a Tailwind CSS or styling-related task.

=== laravel/fortify rules ===

# Laravel Fortify

- Fortify is a headless authentication backend that provides authentication routes and controllers for Laravel applications.
- IMPORTANT: Always use the `search-docs` tool for detailed Laravel Fortify patterns and documentation.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `developing-with-fortify` skill when working with Fortify authentication features.

=== spatie/laravel-activitylog rules ===

# spatie/laravel-activitylog

Activity logging package for Laravel. Logs model events and manual activities to a database table.

## Key Concepts

- **Activity**: An Eloquent model (`Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity`) storing log entries with subject, causer, event, attribute_changes, and properties.
- **Subject**: The model being acted upon (polymorphic `subject_type`/`subject_id`).
- **Causer**: The model that caused the action, typically the authenticated user (polymorphic `causer_type`/`causer_id`).
- **LogOptions**: Fluent configuration object returned by `getActivitylogOptions()` on models using the `LogsActivity` trait.
- **ActivityEvent**: Enum with cases `Created`, `Updated`, `Deleted`, `Restored`.
- **`attribute_changes`** column: stores `{"attributes": {...}, "old": {...}}` for tracked model changes.
- **`properties`** column: stores custom user data set via `withProperties()`.

## Traits

### `LogsActivity`

Add to models to automatically log create/update/delete events. Optionally implement `getActivitylogOptions()` to configure which attributes to track (defaults to logging events without attribute changes).

```php
use Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Concerns\LogsActivity;
use Spatie\Activitylog\Support\LogOptions;

class Article extends Model
{
    use LogsActivity;

    public function getActivitylogOptions(): LogOptions
    {
        return LogOptions::defaults()
            ->logFillable()
            ->logOnlyDirty()
            ->dontLogEmptyChanges();
    }
}
```

### `CausesActivity`

Add to user/causer models. Provides `activitiesAsCauser()` relationship.

### `HasActivity`

Combines `LogsActivity` and `CausesActivity`. Provides `activities()`, `activitiesAsSubject()`, and `activitiesAsCauser()`.

## Manual Logging

```php
activity()
    ->performedOn($article)
    ->causedBy($user)
    ->event(ActivityEvent::Updated)
    ->withProperties(['key' => 'value'])
    ->log('Article was updated');
```

## LogOptions Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `logFillable()` | Log all fillable attributes |
| `logAll()` | Log all attributes |
| `logOnly(array)` | Log specific attributes |
| `logExcept(array)` | Exclude attributes |
| `logOnlyDirty()` | Only log changed attributes |
| `dontLogEmptyChanges()` | Skip logging when no tracked attributes changed |
| `dontLogIfAttributesChangedOnly(array)` | Ignore updates that only change these attributes |
| `useLogName(string)` | Set custom log name |
| `setDescriptionForEvent(Closure)` | Custom description per event |
| `useAttributeRawValues(array)` | Store raw (uncast) values |

## Querying Activities

```php
use Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity;
use Spatie\Activitylog\Enums\ActivityEvent;

Activity::forEvent(ActivityEvent::Created)->get();
Activity::causedBy($user)->get();
Activity::forSubject($article)->get();
Activity::inLog('orders')->get();
```

## Setting the causer

Override the causer for a block of code:

```php
use Spatie\Activitylog\Facades\Activity;

Activity::defaultCauser($admin, function () {
    // all activities here are caused by $admin
});

// or set globally for the rest of the request
Activity::defaultCauser($admin);
```

## Disabling Logging

```php
activity()->withoutLogging(function () {
    // no activities logged here
});
```

## Accessing Changes and Properties

```php
$activity = Activity::latest()->first();

// Tracked model changes (set automatically by LogsActivity)
$activity->attribute_changes; // Collection: {"attributes": {...}, "old": {...}}

// Custom user data (set via withProperties)
$activity->properties; // Collection
$activity->getProperty('key'); // single value
```

## Custom Activity Model

Set `activity_model` in `config/activitylog.php` to a class that extends `Model` and implements `Spatie\Activitylog\Contracts\Activity`. Use a custom model for custom table names or database connections.

## Customizing Actions

The package uses action classes (`LogActivityAction`, `CleanActivityLogAction`) that can be extended and swapped via config:

```php
// config/activitylog.php
'actions' => [
    'log_activity' => \App\Actions\CustomLogActivityAction::class,
    'clean_log' => \App\Actions\CustomCleanAction::class,
],
```

Custom action classes must extend the originals. Override protected methods (`save()`, `beforeActivityLogged()`, `resolveDescription()`, etc.) to customize behavior.

## Configuration

Key config options in `config/activitylog.php`:
- `enabled`: Master on/off switch (env: `ACTIVITYLOG_ENABLED`)
- `clean_after_days`: Days to keep records for `activitylog:clean` command
- `default_log_name`: Default log name (string)
- `default_auth_driver`: Auth driver for causer resolution
- `include_soft_deleted_subjects`: Include soft-deleted subjects
- `activity_model`: Custom Activity model class
- `default_except_attributes`: Globally excluded attributes
- `actions.log_activity`: Action class for logging activities
- `actions.clean_log`: Action class for cleaning old activities

## Agent Core Rules

Rules berikut bersifat **non-negotiable** dan harus diikuti di setiap sesi kerja pada proyek ini.

---

## 1. Response Language: Bahasa Indonesia (MANDATORY)

### Strict Rules

- **ALWAYS** respond in Bahasa Indonesia for ALL communications — no exceptions.
- This applies to: explanations, clarification questions, error messages, suggestions, technical discussions, commit message descriptions, debugging explanations, and every other form of communication with the user.
- **NEVER** switch to English or any other language unless the user explicitly requests it.
- If unsure, default to Bahasa Indonesia.

### Exceptions (Remain in English)

The following elements should remain in English as they are part of programming conventions:

- Variable names, function names, class names, and code identifiers.
- Programming syntax and language-specific keywords.
- Library, package, framework, and tool names.
- Git commit messages (optional — follow user preference).
- Technical configuration file contents (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.).

### Example

```
✅ Correct:
"Saya akan membuat komponen React untuk halaman login. Pertama, mari kita install dependency yang dibutuhkan..."

❌ Wrong:
"I'll create a React component for the login page. First, let's install the required dependencies..."
```

### Code Comments

- All inline code comments MUST be written in **Bahasa Indonesia**.
- JSDoc/TSDoc: descriptions in Bahasa Indonesia, type annotations remain in English.

```typescript
/**
 * Mengambil data pengguna berdasarkan ID.
 * Mengembalikan null jika pengguna tidak ditemukan.
 *
 * @param userId - ID unik pengguna
 * @returns Data pengguna atau null
 */
async function fetchUserData(userId: string): Promise<User | null> {
  // Validasi input sebelum melakukan query ke database
  if (!userId) return null;

  // Ambil data dari database
  const user = await db.users.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
  return user;
}
```

### Communication Tone

- Explain every technical decision in Bahasa Indonesia.
- If a breaking change or deprecation is found, inform the user in Bahasa Indonesia with alternative solutions.
- When suggesting architectural changes, provide clear reasoning in Bahasa Indonesia.
- Error messages directed at the user must be in Bahasa Indonesia.
- Internal technical logs may remain in English.

---

## 2. Mandatory Use of Context7 MCP

### Strict Rules

- **ALWAYS** use Context7 MCP to fetch current documentation before writing any code that involves external libraries, frameworks, or tools.
- This applies to **all** of the following situations:
  - Using libraries/frameworks already present in the project.
  - Adding new libraries/frameworks to the project.
  - Upgrading or migrating library versions.
  - Writing code that depends on any external library API.
  - Fixing bugs related to library usage.
  - Configuring build tools, bundlers, or dev tooling.

### How to Use

Append `use context7` to every internal prompt when documentation reference is needed. Context7 will automatically fetch up-to-date, version-specific documentation from official sources.

### Required Workflow

```
1. User requests a feature/change involving the tech stack
2. MANDATORY: Use Context7 to fetch current documentation
3. Verify that APIs, methods, and patterns match the current version
4. Only then write/modify code based on accurate documentation
5. If there is a conflict between internal knowledge and Context7, ALWAYS PRIORITIZE Context7 results
```

### Situations Requiring Context7

| Situation | Context7 Action |
|---|---|
| Creating a new React component | Check React docs for the project's installed version |
| Setting up Next.js routing | Check App Router vs Pages Router for the installed Next.js version |
| Configuring Tailwind CSS | Check config syntax for the current Tailwind version |
| Querying database with Prisma | Check Prisma Client API for the installed version |
| Adding Express middleware | Check current Express middleware patterns |
| Setting up authentication | Check docs for the auth library in use (NextAuth, Clerk, etc.) |
| Third-party API integration | Check the latest SDK/library wrapper version |
| Configuring Vite/Webpack/Turbopack | Check bundler docs for current configuration API |

### Prohibited Actions

```
❌ Writing code based on training data without Context7 verification
❌ Assuming an API or method is still valid without checking current docs
❌ Skipping Context7 because you believe you already "know" a library
❌ Using patterns or syntax that may have been deprecated
```

---

## 3. Context7 MCP Configuration

### Setup via CLI (Recommended)

```bash
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest
```

### Setup via Remote HTTP

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http context7 https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
```

### Manual Setup (claude_desktop_config.json or .mcp.json)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Setup with API Key (Higher Rate Limits)

Get a free API key at [context7.com/dashboard](https://context7.com/dashboard).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Verify Connection

```bash
claude mcp list
```

Ensure the output shows `context7` with `✓ Connected` status.

---

## 4. Mandatory Coding Principles

The following coding principles **MUST** be applied in every piece of code that is written, modified, or reviewed. The goal is to produce software that is maintainable, scalable, readable, and minimizes technical debt for long-term collaboration.

### SOLID Principles (Object-Oriented Design)

- **Single Responsibility (SRP)**: A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change. If a class handles more than one responsibility, split it into separate classes.

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong: One class handling multiple responsibilities
class UserService {
  createUser() { /* ... */ }
  sendEmail() { /* ... */ }
  generateReport() { /* ... */ }
}

// ✅ Correct: Each class has a single responsibility
class UserService {
  createUser() { /* ... */ }
}
class EmailService {
  sendEmail() { /* ... */ }
}
class ReportService {
  generateReport() { /* ... */ }
}
```

- **Open/Closed (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. Use abstractions so new features can be added without altering existing code.

- **Liskov Substitution (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering program correctness. Every derived class must fulfill the contract of its parent class.

- **Interface Segregation (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Split large interfaces into smaller, focused ones.

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong: Interface is too broad
interface Worker {
  work(): void;
  eat(): void;
  sleep(): void;
}

// ✅ Correct: Small and focused interfaces
interface Workable {
  work(): void;
}
interface Feedable {
  eat(): void;
}
```

- **Dependency Inversion (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions (interfaces), not concrete implementations. High-level modules must not depend directly on low-level modules.

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong: Direct dependency on concrete implementation
class OrderService {
  private mysqlDb = new MySQLDatabase();
}

// ✅ Correct: Depends on an abstraction
class OrderService {
  constructor(private db: DatabaseInterface) {}
}
```

### Clean Code & Design Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplication of logic. If the same code exists in two or more places, extract it into a reusable function or module.

- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Avoid unnecessary complexity. Prioritize readability and simplicity. A simple working solution beats a complex "elegant" one.

- **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**: Do not add functionality until it is actually needed. Do not write code for hypothetical future requirements.

- **Clean Code / Readability**: Use meaningful variable and function names, consistent formatting, and simple logic. Code should be self-documenting.

- **Abstraction**: Hide internal complexity and only expose necessary interfaces. Abstraction layers help isolate changes and reduce coupling.

### Best Practices for Implementation

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing code. Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR strictly.

- **Continuous Refactoring**: Regularly improve code structure without changing behavior. Boy Scout Rule: leave code better than you found it.

- **Code Reviews**: Utilize peer reviews to maintain code quality, standards, and consistency.

- **Security by Design**: Validate all input, sanitize data, and manage dependencies regularly. Security is a foundation, not an afterthought.

```
Basic security checklist:
- Validate and sanitize all user input
- Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- Never hardcode secrets or credentials in source code
- Update dependencies regularly for security patches
- Apply the principle of least privilege
```

### Agent Enforcement Table

| Principle | How the Agent Applies It |
|---|---|
| SRP | Every function/class/module handles only one responsibility |
| OCP | Use patterns that allow extension without modification |
| LSP | Ensure inheritance and polymorphism are correctly applied |
| ISP | Create small, focused interfaces |
| DIP | Inject dependencies through constructors or parameters |
| DRY | Identify and eliminate code duplication |
| KISS | Choose the simplest solution that fulfills the requirement |
| YAGNI | Only implement what is requested — nothing more |
| TDD | Write tests before implementation — always |
| Security | Always validate input and follow security best practices |

---

## 5. Additional Rules

### Code Quality

- Always follow best practices from official documentation (fetched via Context7).
- Use TypeScript if the project already uses TypeScript.
- Add adequate error handling in all code paths.
- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code.

### Error Handling

- Error messages shown to users should be descriptive and in Bahasa Indonesia.
- Internal technical logs may use English conventions.
- When debugging, explain the process and findings in Bahasa Indonesia.
